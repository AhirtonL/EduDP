# Data Science Design Pattern for Education Analytics

##Introduction 
This Data Science Design Pattern provides a starting point for the data scientist exploring a new dataset in the education world by using R. The current version covers two typical use cases:
- Student Drop-out Prediction
- Student Score Modeling

By no means is it the endpoint of the data science journey. The pattern is under regular revision and improvement and is provided as is.

##Getting Started
To get the code up and running on your own system, you should make sure
1.	Jupyter Notebook along with Rkernel and Notedown are installed
2.	R version 3.2 and 3.3 are needed

##Build and Test
The code is built by using R Markdown and then converted into Jupyter Notebook by using Notedown.
